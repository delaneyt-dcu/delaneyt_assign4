160102 - first commit
To-date, used CK's actionTabFragPager demo as template
Completed tabs and event frag
Leaving the action bar to the end
Got gallery frag working with imageView activity working
Up-arrow in imageView activity returns to home screen and not gallery frag

Will park this for time being and start match frag next

160106 - second commit
Up-date, completed match frag but app kept crashing
I tested a few possible reasons:
1. I had renamed the folders from edu/oscail to com/example, therefore:
	Decided to start app again from sketch keeping original folder names from actionTabFragPager demo
	Found app started to crash again only when I created the Team A and B fragments within a match fragment
	Match fragment was originally an activity.
2. Following research: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6672066/fragment-inside-fragment
	I realise that fragments cannot hold other fragments earlier the API Level 17. My min Level is 16.
	I rewrote the Match fragment again incorporating the code of the team fragments within.
	App works fine now apart from the very occasional crash which I attribute to lack of memory on device.
I noticed that the team names, score and match stats are all retained when I switch between screens
Apart from when I tab on the match tab which is also the frag displayed upon launch
I will work on this next along with the Up-arrow in imageView activity not returning to gallery frag

160113 - third commit
Up-date, could not solve:
1. Back arrow still reverts back to launch activity as opposed to gallery fragment
2. memberVaribles hold their value but display their xml default value when:
	a. device orientation changed;
	b. when match fragment (same as launch fragment) is resumed.

***** ADD MY RESEARCH HERE LATER *****

Decided to pack this and move-on.
Got the setting fragment working as required.
Things to-do:
1. work on the action bar tabs, ie share, settings for all fragments
2. back arrow to gallery frag
3. memberVaribles
4. test
5. add comments and java code
6. update README (check spelling with Words) and commit to github repository

160118 - forth commit
App fully working apart from checking screen orienation layouts.
Of the Things to-do checklist:
1. All menu items action tabs working
2. back arrow was resolved by overriding onOptionsItemSelected(MenuItem item) and
setting it to android.R.id.home
3. Solved the memberVaribles problem. turns out that all I need to add was 'android:freezesText="true" />'
to my xml file which forces the textview to save its state
ref: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5179686/restoring-state-of-textview-after-screen-rotation

Still need to do:
4. more testing. In screen changed to landscape orienation, keyboard always pops up even when not called
5. add more comments and more java code
6. update README (check spelling with Words) and commit to github repository
