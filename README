Will park this for time being and start match frag next

160106 - second commit
Up-date, completed match frag but app kept crashing
I tested a few posible reasons:
1. I had renamed the folders from edu/oscail to com/example, therefore:
	Decided to start app again from sketch keeping original folder names from actionTabFragPager demo
	Found app started to crash again only when I created the Team A and B fragments within a match fragment
	Match fragment was orginally an activity.
2. Following research: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6672066/fragment-inside-fragment
	I realise that  fragments cannot hold other fragments earlier the API Level 17. My min Level is 16.
	I rewrote the Match fragment again incorporating the code of the team fragments within.
	App works fine now apart form the very oscasional crash which I attribute to lack of memory on device.
I noticed that the team names, score and match stats are all retained when I switch between screens
Apart from when I tab on the match tab which is also the frag displayed upon launch
I will work on this next along with the Up-arrow in imageView activity not returning to gallery frag
